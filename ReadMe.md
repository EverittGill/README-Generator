# Readme Generator

## Description

- I was motivated to build this project to have a more convenient way to write Readme files. 
- It solves the problem of having to constantly look up the proper format to write the file
- From making this I learned about NPM and Inquirer



## Installation and Usage

To use the program just download it form the repository and open it up in your terminal. After that run the command "npm install inquirer@8.2.4" then "node index.js" and then answer the questions. When you get to the end there will be a new file available for you and that's your newly constructed Readme file.
